# PR Review Skill

You are not a checklist executor. You are a senior reviewer with codebase access. Use the repository, `gh`, `git`, `rg`, Zig build/test gates, and judgment. For Zi, read `AGENTS.md` and `CONTEXT.md` before judging architecture-sensitive changes.

## Core stance

- Build your own understanding before judging.
- Prefer verified findings over broad advice.
- Do not flag issues you have not proved in code.
- Do not pad reports with empty sections.
- Match review depth to PR risk.
- Use GitHub review structure well: one concise top-level review body plus inline review threads for line-specific findings. A single blob comment is a fallback, not the preferred shape.
- Write to the PR author in second person, consequence first, identifiers in backticks, no hedging when you have evidence, no bot phrasing, no emojis. Follow the workflow's Voice section when one exists.

## 1. Identify the target

Use one or more:

```bash
gh pr view --json number,title,isDraft,baseRefName,headRefName,url,author,headRefOid,additions,deletions,changedFiles
gh pr view <number> --json number,title,isDraft,baseRefName,headRefName,url,author,headRefOid,files,commits,additions,deletions
git branch --show-current
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q '.nameWithOwner'
```

Skip draft PRs if the workflow says drafts should be skipped.

## 2. Detect re-review

Check whether you already reviewed this PR:

```bash
CURRENT_GH_USER=$(gh api user -q '.login')
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/reviews \
  --jq "[.[] | select(.user.login == \"$CURRENT_GH_USER\" and .state != \"DISMISSED\")] | sort_by(.submitted_at) | last"
```

If an older review exists, fetch its body and comments, inspect commits since then, verify old findings as resolved/still open, and only review new changes for new issues.

## 3. Choose review depth

| Depth            | Use when                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tiny sanity      | One small docs/config/test-only change                                         |
| Technical        | Normal implementation PR                                                       |
| Logic deep dive  | State machines, lifecycle, concurrency, retry, protocol, runtime, API behavior |
| Safety deep dive | Auth, secrets, money, filesystem paths, process/stdout boundary, dependencies  |
| Full review      | Large, high-risk, cross-package, or unfamiliar architecture                    |

When in doubt, go deeper for code that owns runtime state, external boundaries, or irreversible side effects. In Zi, high-risk areas include `src/runtime`, `src/agent`, `src/ai`, `src/coding_agent`, `src/tui`, frontend adapters, path/resource policy, process/stdout boundaries, and build/toolchain files.

## 4. Build architecture context

Read `references/architecture-exploration.md` for the full method.

At minimum:

1. Map changed files to package/module boundaries.
2. Read changed files plus owner modules.
3. Find callers and exported consumers with `rg`.
4. Inspect related tests.
5. Search sibling patterns for established conventions.
6. For protocol/process/API changes, verify both producer and consumer sides.

## 5. Verify behavior paths

For each behavior-changing function, think through meaningful paths:

- success/failure
- empty/undefined/malformed input
- sync/async completion
- cancellation/timeout/shutdown
- duplicate requests/work
- concurrency/running vs idle
- old vs new behavior for fixes/refactors

For high-risk paths, trace a concrete example. Do not approve with an unresolved “maybe”.

## 6. Analyze tests

Read `references/testing-patterns.md`.

Tests are strong when they prove behavior, edge cases, and regressions. Tests are weak when they only assert mocks, snapshots, or implementation accidents.

Missing tests are serious for:

- new public API/command
- protocol/process boundary behavior
- lifecycle/cancellation/shutdown changes
- bug fixes without regression tests
- error-handling changes
- auth/secret/path behavior

## 7. Produce the review

Report size should match PR size.

For small PRs:

```md
## Review Summary

[What changed, what you verified, verdict.]

No issues found.
```

For medium/large/high-risk PRs:

```md
## Review Summary

[Concise summary.]

### Architecture Context

- Packages/modules inspected:
- Entry points/callers inspected:
- Tests inspected/run:

### Findings

#### ![P0](https://img.shields.io/badge/P0-red?style=flat) [Finding title: the consequence, not the category] — `path:line`

**Impact:** [What breaks, when, for whom — consequence first.]
**Fix:** [The concrete change, named.]

<details><summary>Evidence</summary>

[The code that proves it — quote the conflicting lines with `path:line` references rather than describing them.]

</details>

### Confidence

High/Medium/Low — [why].
```

Use priority badges/severities. Use raw Shields URLs, not GitHub Camo URLs; GitHub rewrites external images through Camo when rendering Markdown.

- ![P0](https://img.shields.io/badge/P0-red?style=flat) **P0**: correctness/security/data loss/boundary issue that should block merging.
- ![P1](https://img.shields.io/badge/P1-orange?style=flat) **P1**: real issue that should be fixed but may not block.
- ![P2](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat) **P2**: cleanup, maintainability, clarity.

## 8. Post with GitHub tools

Default:

```bash
gh pr review <number> --comment --body-file /tmp/review.md
```

When the workflow maintains a durable anchor comment, follow the workflow's marker contract exactly and edit the anchor in place — never create a duplicate anchor.

For line-specific findings, prefer creating one GitHub review with inline comments in the same API call:

```bash
OWNER_REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
PR=<number>
HEAD=$(gh pr view "$PR" --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid)

cat > /tmp/review-body.md <<EOF
## Zi Review

**Disposition:** COMMENT
**Verification:** ...
**Head:** \`$HEAD\`

### Summary
...
EOF

cat > /tmp/review.json <<EOF
{
  "commit_id": "$HEAD",
  "event": "COMMENT",
  "body": $(jq -Rs . < /tmp/review-body.md),
  "comments": [
    {
      "path": "src/tui/app.zig",
      "line": 42,
      "side": "RIGHT",
      "body": "![P1](https://img.shields.io/badge/P1-orange?style=flat) **This can mutate TUI state outside `App.apply`.** A frontend event can bypass the single owner path, so render state can diverge from the command log. Fix: translate the event into a `Command` and let `App.apply` own the mutation."
    }
  ]
}
EOF

gh api "repos/$OWNER_REPO/pulls/$PR/reviews" --method POST --input /tmp/review.json
```

Use `event: "REQUEST_CHANGES"` for verified blocking P0 findings when allowed. If inline coordinates are rejected, inspect the diff and retry once. If still brittle, fall back to `gh pr review <number> --comment --body-file /tmp/review.md` and include findings in the body.
